SelfControl for Linux

This is a Ubuntu, Debian, Linux port of the popular Mac OS X application
SelfControl.  The idea is simple, You wish to get some work done and you
need to avoid certain internet distractions like web sites, email, etc.

Install this application, start it up (it lives under the
"Applications->Internet->Self Control" menu.  You add a few problem
sites to your list, say metafilter.com, reddit.com, and example.com.
Then you set how long you wish to block these sites, say 50 minutes.
Then you click the 'Start' button.  Once you type your password those
sites will be blocked for the duration you set.

This is not perfect, it blocks the IP address with a firewall and
adds an entry to your 'hosts' file.  This usually works, but some
sites have so many names/IP addresses that you will have to use trial
and error to find out what names you need to block.

A possibly better description may be found on the SelfControl for Linux
Homepage (http://svn.jklmnop.net/projects/SelfControl.html).

This is developed on Ubuntu Lucid Lynx, should probably work on
Debian, would take some hacking about for CentOS/RedHat/Other.
It uses generic Linux tools: Perl, Gtk2, YAML, iptables, at, ed, sudo.
